This script downloads ARM builds of PhantomJS from the Arch Linux ARM servers and packages them to look like the official PhantomJS download archives.

#Why?
ARM builds of PhantomJS are not officially supported by the PhantomJS team, and building them requires a lot of time/hardware. To solve this problem, the script piggy backs on the work of the Arch Linux ARM build servers, who already compile them for us.

#Where can I find the ARM archives built by this script?
